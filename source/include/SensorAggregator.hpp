//! \addtogroup 0028 PolarView Aggregator
//! \brief A PolarView Aggregator turns several PolarViews into one PolarView
//!
//! A PolarView Aggregator takes multiple PolarViews that are given to it by
//! sensors and moves the origin of the polarviews to the actual origin of the
//! system. This way you only have to check one polarview from a good origin
//! instead of several that are apart from eachother.

//! \brief  Header of SensorAggregator
//!
//! This class is used to add sensors to a vector so they can be used to easily
//! get the data from the sensors.
